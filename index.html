<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Devonya and I am a Dallas native. I enjoy shoujo anime, 2000s sci-fi and urban fantasy shows, many different kinds of music, and spending time traveling with my adult daughter. I am taking the class to jump start a career change. I have been in the same spaces for 20 years and would like flexibility and the ability to travel more. Hopefully, taking this class and getting an Associates degree will send me in the right direction.</p>

<h2>My Avatar</h2>
<p>My avatar is the water symbol that symbolizes Aquarius. Despite having very little knowledge about astrology, I find that many things I have read really do reflect my personality. I am a rebellious kind independent that marches to the beat of their own drum. After all, Aquarius is an <em>air sign</em> which makes it even more clear that we are unique.</p>

<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<p>Many years ago, I decided that I wanted to be great at graphic design and started my journey to learn Photoshop and Illustrator. I took several night classes with the idea in mind to make book covers. I sent my work out to many indie authors in hopes that someone would hire me to create their next book cover.</p> 
<p>I was lucky enough to reach out to someone who happened to be in a hurry to have a cover produced. She loved my cover, used it, and told others about me. After that initial book cover, in just a under a year I had a flourishing freelance graphic design business.</p>

<h2>What Came Next</h2>
<p>Over the years, I did freelance graphic design work that helped me break into freelance web design. Despite having a lot of fun doing that, time went on and things got much easier for the everyday person to create their own website. While that accessibility is great for them, business for me died down to nothing. After so many years without having to practice, I’d forgotten all that I knew. I didn’t think much of it because life kept moving and since web design work was no longer paying, I moved into a different field.</p>

<h2>And Now?</h2>
<p>Now, in 2024, my career goals have changed and I am back learning web development. While this is the first step to a new degree on a new path, I am hoping that what I learn will land me a job in a new market that will allow me to travel the world. This class is just the beginning.</p>
<p>As of this moment, I do not have a specific project in mind but I know that <strong>I love astronomy</strong> and may lean into creating a website that will showcase how much I enjoy it. I am still learning the skills and techniques required to do this but I know my professor will help me get to where I need to be.</p>
